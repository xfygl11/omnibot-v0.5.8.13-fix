# Codex Bot Runner Notes

The Codex bot workflow is `.github/workflows/codex-bot.yml`.

Authentication can be provided in either of these ways:

- Preferred for this self-hosted runner: configure Codex CLI for the runner user, currently `cicd`.
- Optional fallback: set the repository secret `OPENAI_API_KEY`; the workflow passes it to `codex exec` when present.

Optional repository variables:

- `CODEX_RUNNER_USER`: runner account used by `codex exec`; defaults to `cicd`.
- `CODEX_MODEL`: override the Codex model.
- `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT`: override reasoning effort.
- `CODEX_CLI_SANDBOX`: sandbox passed to `codex exec`; defaults to `danger-full-access` because this self-hosted runner's `bubblewrap` may not support the options Codex uses for `read-only` / `workspace-write`.

The workflow intentionally does not switch users with `sudo`. Run the GitHub Actions runner service as `CODEX_RUNNER_USER` so Codex can use that account's existing CLI config without password prompts.

If `cicd` has passwordless sudo, consider running a separate self-hosted runner service as a dedicated low-privilege account such as `cicd-codex` and setting `CODEX_RUNNER_USER=cicd-codex`.

The workflow still keeps a separate logical write policy. External issues and read-only commands can run with the permissive local CLI sandbox, but their diffs are not published. Maintainer-approved write commands on fork PRs publish to a repository-owned `codex/pr-*` branch and open a draft follow-up PR instead of pushing to the contributor's fork branch.
